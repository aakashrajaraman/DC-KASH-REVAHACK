                              Waste Categorization and Management Using Computer Vision & Artificial Intelligence.

Problem Preview: 

Due to widespread inefficiencies and mismanagament of waste in cities, the upsurge in disease, injuury, pests, and unhygenic conditions has become an unavoidable aspect of life. As such, there have been several efforts to fix the issue, but no avail. These problems are due to the big and diverse amount of waste produced by a variety of sources. At this point it is essentiwl to develop a solution that not only provides an efficient network of waste collection and management but also allows citizens to take part in it. This involvement of community proves to be a dynamic method of growth and improvement in waste management. This idea proves to be a efficient solution towads waste classification, disposal and management in smart towns and cities.

Description of project:

 Exploratory Data Analysis:
 The dataset used has various categories that describe the different types of wastes. This data is used to train the model as well as test it. The dataset is balaced with 9 categories namely, biological,clothes,general trash, glass,metal, paper, plastic, shies and trash.


Using computer vision and a backend CNN model built upon the MobilenetV2 pretrained layer, along with a fully built neural network to classify the type of waste, users can now
